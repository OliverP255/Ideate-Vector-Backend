# Design Decisions

This document records key design decisions made during implementation, including deviations from the original specification and rationale for choices.

## Phase 0 Decisions

### Environment Configuration

**Decision**: Used `env.template` instead of `.env.template` due to global ignore restrictions.

**Rationale**: The `.env.template` file was blocked by global ignore rules, so we used `env.template` as the template file name. Users should copy this to `.env` for local development.

**Alternatives Considered**:
- Renaming the file to avoid ignore rules
- Using a different configuration approach
- Hardcoding development defaults

### Service Architecture

**Decision**: Implemented service classes with async methods for all business logic.

**Rationale**: This provides a clean separation between API routes and business logic, making the code more testable and maintainable. Async methods allow for better concurrency handling.

**Alternatives Considered**:
- Direct database calls in API routes
- Synchronous service methods
- Function-based approach instead of classes

### Database Schema

**Decision**: Used UUID primary keys for all tables instead of auto-incrementing integers.

**Rationale**: UUIDs provide better distributed system support and avoid ID collision issues. They also provide better security by not exposing sequential IDs.

**Alternatives Considered**:
- Auto-incrementing integers
- Custom ID generation schemes
- Composite keys

### Health Check Implementation

**Decision**: Implemented comprehensive health checks for all external services.

**Rationale**: This provides better observability and allows for proper service dependency management. Health checks are essential for container orchestration and load balancing.

**Alternatives Considered**:
- Simple "alive" checks
- No health checks
- External monitoring only

### Frontend Technology Choices

**Decision**: Used Next.js 14 with App Router, TypeScript, and TailwindCSS.

**Rationale**: Next.js provides excellent performance and developer experience. TypeScript ensures type safety, and TailwindCSS provides rapid UI development. The App Router is the modern approach for Next.js.

**Alternatives Considered**:
- React with Create React App
- Vue.js or Angular
- Plain HTML/CSS/JavaScript

### Map Visualization

**Decision**: Used deck.gl for WebGL-based map visualization.

**Rationale**: deck.gl provides excellent performance for large datasets and integrates well with React. It supports WebGL rendering which is essential for handling millions of document points.

**Alternatives Considered**:
- Leaflet with custom layers
- Mapbox GL JS with custom overlays
- D3.js for custom visualization

### Container Strategy

**Decision**: Used Docker Compose for development and prepared for Kubernetes deployment.

**Rationale**: Docker Compose provides easy local development setup, while Kubernetes manifests are prepared for production deployment. This covers both development and production needs.

**Alternatives Considered**:
- Docker Swarm
- Local development without containers
- Cloud-native services only

### Testing Strategy

**Decision**: Implemented comprehensive testing with unit, integration, and e2e tests.

**Rationale**: Testing is critical for a system handling user data and providing search functionality. The three-tier testing approach ensures reliability at all levels.

**Alternatives Considered**:
- Manual testing only
- Unit tests only
- Contract testing

## Future Decisions

As the project progresses through additional phases, more decisions will be documented here, including:

- Embedding model selection
- Dimensionality reduction algorithm choices
- Caching strategies
- Performance optimization approaches
- Security implementations
- Monitoring and alerting setup

## Decision Process

All decisions follow this process:
1. Identify the problem or choice
2. Research alternatives
3. Evaluate trade-offs
4. Document rationale
5. Implement and test
6. Review and iterate if needed

This ensures that all architectural choices are deliberate and well-reasoned.
